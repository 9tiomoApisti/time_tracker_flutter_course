The 1950s was a decade of transition and innovation in animation. While the traditional hand-drawn animation dominated by Disney continued to produce classics like *Cinderella*, *Peter Pan*, and *Lady and the Tramp*, other studios experimented with new techniques and styles. For example, UPA (United Productions of America) created a distinctive and minimalist style of animation that influenced the design of TV cartoons like *The Flintstones* and *The Jetsons*. UPA also produced some of the most acclaimed animated shorts of the decade, such as *Gerald McBoing-Boing*, *Rooty Toot Toot*, and *The Tell-Tale Heart*.
 
Another trend in the 1950s was the rise of stop-motion animation, which used puppets, clay, or cut-outs to create realistic and expressive movements. Some of the pioneers of this technique were George Pal, who made the Puppetoons series and sci-fi films like *The War of the Worlds* and *The Time Machine*; Ray Harryhausen, who created the memorable creatures for films like *The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms* and *The 7th Voyage of Sinbad*; and JiÅÃ­ Trnka, who made artistic and poetic films like *The Emperor's Nightingale* and *Old Czech Legends*.
 
The 1950s also saw the emergence of animation from other countries, especially Japan, where the first feature-length anime film, *MomotarÅ: Sacred Sailors*, was released in 1945. The decade also witnessed the debut of Osamu Tezuka, who is considered the father of manga and anime. His first animated film, *Tale of a Street Corner*, was released in 1962. Other notable Japanese animators of the 1950s include KenzÅ Masaoka, who made the first anime film with synchronized sound, *The Dance of the Chagamas*; Taiji Yabushita, who directed Japan's first color animated feature, *Hakujaden*; and TÅei Animation, which became Japan's largest animation studio.
